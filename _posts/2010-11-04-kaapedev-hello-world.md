Hello independent game development world!
<br/><br/>
You have just gained a contributor for making the world a little more fun.
<br/><br/>
In my spare time I try to develop casual games, currently with C# and the XNA framework, addressing gamers on the Xbox 360.
<br/><br/>
I am in my early twenties, just finished my Bachelors degree in Applied Computer Science, working for a big IT company and studying part-time for my Master of Science in Business & Process Management. For more basic and personal stuff see About [no longer available].
<br/><br/>
This blog should document the development process of the games that I make and generally help me to present my games to a broader audience. Hopefully it will also help to increase the quality of my games by feedback from you!
<br/><br/>
I try to at least add an update once per week to this blog, so stay tuned.
