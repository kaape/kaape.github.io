During this week I made major updates in my current technology level.
<br/><br/>
I got a new business laptop, [Elitebook 8540w](http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF05a/321957-321957-64295-3740645-4307559-4096175.html) and it is AWESOME! Work is fun again.
<br/><br/>
Finally my [Palm Pre Plus](http://www.palm.com/us/products/phones/preplus/index.html) arrived and there’s a lot of stuff to explore. Currently I’m trying to install Navit and use the Pre for car navigation. We’ll see if that works.
<br/><br/>
Long work days this week, so not much spare time for game development. I hope to find some time this weekend to make progress on Avatar Tower.
To verify the progress of the weekend on monday, this is the current state:
