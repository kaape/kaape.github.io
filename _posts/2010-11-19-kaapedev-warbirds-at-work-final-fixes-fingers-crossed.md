WAW failed for the second time in peer-review due to an exit code 4 (exception on top level) and some other minor bugs.
Next to these demotivating issues was the feedback basically good.
<br/><br/>
I will fix these bugs over the weekend and submit it for playtest until next friday.
Perhaps I’m preparing a small trailer for the game, too.

No time for development on Avatar Tower this week. We’ve been honoured in the “Neues Schloss” in Stuttgart for finishing our Bachelor Degree. That was a nice opportunity to see all former colleagues once again.
