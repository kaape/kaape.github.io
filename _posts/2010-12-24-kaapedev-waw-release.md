This is my first release for the Xbox Live Indie Games (done in collaboration with a former colleague â€“ thanks for the graphics Ax!). It is a casual singleplayer shmup that helped me a lot in learning the capabilities of XNA.
<br/><br/>
It provides the following features:

* 7 environments with 7 boss formations
* 7 different powerups
* 24 different enemy variants
* 5 weapons
* endless fun by random level generation
