Currently I’ve got two term papers to write, two case studies to work on, a heavy test in two weeks and furthermore I need to find a new apartment and prepare the move. Luckily I can reduce my normal work at the office to focus on my studies.
<br/><br/>
Due to these issues I will try a new work model for my little spare time. During the next week I will block the hours from 22:00 to 24:00 every day for development of Avatar Tower. We’ll see if that works. Hopefully I can present some new features at the end of next week.

*Slightly Offtopic*: I’m pleased to see that one of my former colleagues has released an app on iTunes. Go to [turbolent.com](http://turbolent.com) to check “Objects” out. He’s going to study for his Master's degree in Denmark and I wish him all the best for his start.
