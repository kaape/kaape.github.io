As you may have noticed, I have been quite busy for the last months. The studies are taking a lot of time, but I learnt a lot that might come handy in my future work life. I am continuously collecting all the information needed for starting my own small company üôÇ

I added the link to the [Axperience System](http://axperience.wordpress.com/) blog of my former colleague and friend Axel. He developed a nice little website, that lets you generate chat rooms instantly. Check it out at [chattory.com](http://chattory.com)!

Today our class wrote the last two exams of this semester. On friday we will take an oral exam and on sunday I will submit the last term paper. Then I am finally free for the summer! Well, except for my normal work amount. Next week we will begin our [Certified Associate in Project Management](http://www.pmi.org/Certification/Certified-Associate-in-Project-Management-CAPM.aspx) training, so that I can take an exam sometime this summer. Perhaps I will even prepare for the [Certified Professional for Requirement Engineering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Professional_for_Requirements_Engineering) afterwards, presumed I found the spare time for that.

Currently I‚Äôm working with the Google Web Toolkit, that seems to be my path to the web development world, as I couldn‚Äôt become friends with PHP, JavaScript, JSP or any other web technology. I really enjoy working in a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù Java environment that integrates well into my existing work style. For my next project I have an awesome idea growing in the back of my head, that heavily relies on the GWT. But first things first, Avatar Tower here I come!
