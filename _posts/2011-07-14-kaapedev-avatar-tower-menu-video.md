As the menu structure is hard to describe by screenshots I made a little video to show you the current menu flow and also the current gameplay. Unfortunately I am missing the right hardware to record directly from the Xbox and had to  fall back on a digital camera at the cost of video quality. If someone knows an inexpensive way to capture the xbox via PC, please share.

I also tried different background styles but am not statisifed with the results. It seems there is still a lot of graphical tweaking necessary.
