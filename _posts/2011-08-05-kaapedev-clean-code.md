Recently I stumbled upon a book that I bought for my bachelor thesis, but didn’t manage to read until now: [Clean Code by Robert C. Martin](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882). A new understanding of the Software Engineering craftsmanship is based on this book, called the [Clean Code Developer](http://www.clean-code-developer.de). It’s full of principles and tips to understand the difference between clean and dirty code and thereby write better code. Although I don’t want to make a career as a Software Engineer (that’s way to hard for me), it’s handy to know the quality difference, for example when it comes to reviewing the work of suppliers. There won’t follow a summary of the book, as there are already tons of good reviews. I just want to point out one thing that caught my interest in particular, [Kent Beck’s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck) four rules of Simple Design:

* Runs all the tests
* Contains no duplication
* Expresses the intent of the programmer
* Minimizes the number of classes and methods

Test Driven Development isn’t something new, but these rules are so simple and plain reasonable, that it’s a shame if one disregards them. As I am currently developing a lot, I will try to follow these guidelines and review my work against them more consciously.
