The playtest phase for Avatar Tower is closed. I got feedback from two community members with minor graphical issues.
<br/><br/>
I just submitted Avatar Tower for release which means the big fear for failure in peer-review has begun. Hopefully this time it will work out better as with Warbirds at Work. As I copied most of the boilerplate code, the typical technical issues shouldn’t arise.
<br/><br/>
Apropos “arise”: I’d like to make a quick copy of [Luftrauser](http://www.vlambeer.com/2011/06/27/luftrauser/) for the Xbox. The working title for it is “AIRrise”. By the end of the coming week I am hopefully in the position to show you some screenshots or even a video. Stay tuned!
