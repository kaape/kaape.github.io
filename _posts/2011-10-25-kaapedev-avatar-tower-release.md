As my premium subscription of Creators Club runs out during the next weeks, this will be my last project for the Xbox. Although I already started to work on a Luftrauser clone I couldnâ€™t manage to get it finished on time. For my future projects I will probably switch to more general topics, but will still use this blog to spread the word.
<br/><br/>
If you want to review Avatar Tower just contact me, I have some redemption codes to give away for free.
<br/><br/>
Happy playing!

<b>Game description:</b>
<br/><br/>
Your Avatar is stuck in a burning tower! Flee from the fire by jumping the platforms. Make combos and collect stars to gain higher scores. Try to break your own highscore!
<br/><br/>
This is my second release for the Xbox Live Indie Games. It is a casual singleplayer arcade game.
<br/><br/>
It provides the following features:

* play with your Avatar
* 10 different platform themes
* 2 powerups
* local highscore
* endless fun by random level generation
