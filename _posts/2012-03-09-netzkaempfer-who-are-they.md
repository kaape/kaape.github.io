Browsergames are a substantial driver of growth for the gaming industry. In the year 2010 alone the spendings on gaming content were about five billion US-Dollar. [We, a founder team of three consultants](/netzkaempfer-migration), want to address this potential. Our innovative gaming concept “Social War” has already been awarded at the [Browsergames Forum Starter Trophy 2011](/netzkaempfer-browsergames-forum). Within the scope of the [Gründerzeit 2012](/netzkaempfer-gruenderzeit) we’ve presented our further developed idea and sought feedback.
