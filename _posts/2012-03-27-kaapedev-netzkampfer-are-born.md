Together with some colleagues I founded the organisation “Netzkämpfer” (eng.: net warriors / net fighters) that is intended for a german audience.

Our mission is to fight for excellent web applications. We’ve started this mission with our first browser game “Social War” which is currently in pre-production.

Although it’s not XBox Indie Games I’m still developing games 🙂
