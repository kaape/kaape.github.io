*Update on Mai 1st 2016: The original project team has disbanded. Some former team members asked for anonymity in my posts. I've changed the original project name to "AppCreator", removed some links and personal information.*
<hr/>

[In my last post](/elevator-pitch-bw-app-creator) I asked for your support by voting for our idea "AppCreator", so we can pitch at the [Elevator Pitch BW 2016](https://www.elevatorpitch-bw.de/) in Böblingen. With 36 votes we were allowed to participate as one of ten contestants. We presented our idea within a three minute timeframe and afterwards the jury questioned us for three minutes. A short description about the event from the organizer can be found at the [Elevator Pitch BW blog](http://blog.elevatorpitch-bw.de/gewinner-regional-cup-boeblingen-2016/).

We pitched our idea successfully and were rewared with the third price and were chosen as the audience favorite as well. That gives us a small chance to participate at the federal state finale in June. The pitch has been published on YouTube, so you may judge our performance for yourself:
