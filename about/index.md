Hi, I'm Kornelius and I'd like to welcome you to my personal site. I am in my late twenties, living together with my wife in Stuttgart and working as a software engineer at my own company <a href="../projects/#ditemis-2014">ditemis</a>.

This site is mainly used as an outlet to document <a href="../posts">my experiences with founding and running a business</a>. You'll also find a <a href="../projects">list of the projects I've done</a> and some of the <a href="../code-art">things I'll do in my spare time</a>.

<br/>
If you have any comments regarding this site or would like to get in contact, please send me an e-mail. I'll do my best to help you.
