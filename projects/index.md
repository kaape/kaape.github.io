This is a curated list of my mentionable side projects from the past and also ongoing ones. It's a nice chronic of the past 10 years with my progression from game programming as a starting point to web programming and a more specialized industry theme. Most of the projects from my professional career as an employee aren't listed for obvious reasons.

## ditemis, 2014

I am the founder of and developer at <a href="http://www.ditemis.com" target="_blank">www.ditemis.com</a>. It is my first serious business venture and was founded in May 2014.

### Runway, 2014

Minimal Mistakes now requires [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) 2.2+. Make sure to run `gem update jekyll` if you aren't on the latest version or `gem install jekyll` if this is your first time installing it.

If you are creating a new Jekyll site using Minimal Mistakes follow these steps:

1. Fork the [Minimal Mistakes repo](http://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/fork).
2. Clone the repo you just forked and rename it.
3. [Install Bundler](http://bundler.io) `gem install bundler` and Run `bundle install` to install all dependencies (Jekyll, [Jekyll-Sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap), [Octopress](https://github.com/octopress/octopress), etc)
4. Update `config.yml`, add navigation, and replace demo posts and pages with your own. Full details below.

If you want to use Minimal Mistakes with an existing Jekyll site follow these steps:

1. [Download Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/archive/master.zip) and unzip.
2. Rename `minimal-mistakes-master` to something meaningful ie: `new-site`
3. Run `bundle install` to install all dependencies (Jekyll, [Jekyll-Sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap), [Octopress](https://github.com/octopress/octopress), etc)
4. Remove demo posts/pages and replace with your own posts, pages, and any other content you want to move over.
5. Update posts' and pages' YAML to match variables used by Minimal Mistakes. Full details below.
6. Update `_config.yml` and add navigation links. Full details below. 

**Pro-tip:** Delete the `gh-pages` branch after cloning and start fresh by branching off `master`. There is a bunch of garbage in `gh-pages` used for the theme's demo site that I'm guessing you won't want.

## PC games, 2003 - 2006

As a teenager I started programming in C++. These first steps were hard, especially considering that C++ isn't exactly a language you would recommend for a beginner without an internet connection. My first programs were small game clones. As my experience grew the scope of the games grew. My proudest achievements from that time are "BurnyWing" and "ZombieSchool". I used the nickname "BurningLegend" back then, which explains why most of the game names contain "Burny".

### ZombieSchool, 2006

A major milestone in my game development "career" was ZombieSchool. It has taught me a valuable lesson in version control systems and reliable backup. After a disk crash nearly all of the project was lost. Only the sources for the website of the game could be restored.

It was a multiplayer only, cooperative, top-down shooter. As a team you had to defend yourself from an invading horde of zombies with a lot of different weapons. Think of "Left 4 Dead" with 2d graphics and a top-down view.

The game was written in C++ with various libaries. A map editor and the server control program was written with [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/). For networking the [ZoidCom library](http://www.zoidcom.com/) was used. [Haaf's Game Engine](http://hge.relishgames.com/) was utilized for graphics and input management.

### BurnyWing, 2004

Shoot 'em ups have always been a genre that I'd liked to play. So it should be expected that my first major game was a shmup. This was also the first time that I needed to develop tools to help with content creation. In the case of "BurnyWing" I developed a map editor. Like in my earlier games I've used [SDL](http://www.libsdl.org) for input, graphics and window management.

### Various game clones, 2003 & 2004

The first fully playable games that I made were clones of "Connect Four", "TicTacToe", "Snake", "Tetris", "Breakout", "Minesweeper" and "Sokoban".
All of them used [SDL](http://www.libsdl.org) as a way to easily draw images, react to keyboard and mouse events and manage the window.

Who says you can't build pretty console graphics with C++?
